# Supervised Machine Learning: Classification and Regression

## Introduction
Supervised Machine Learning is a fundamental branch of artificial intelligence where models are trained on labeled data to make predictions or decisions. It plays a pivotal role in solving real-world problems, from diagnosing diseases to forecasting sales. This README provides an overview of supervised learning, focusing on its two main types: **Classification** and **Regression**, with examples, key concepts, and common algorithms.

## Key Concepts of Supervised Learning
- **Labeled Data:** The dataset contains both input features (independent variables) and output labels (dependent variable or target).
- **Objective:** To learn a mapping function from inputs to outputs (e.g., \( y = f(x) \)).
- **Training and Testing:** Models are trained on a subset of data and evaluated on unseen test data.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, R-squared, and mean squared error (MSE) assess the model's performance.

## 1. Classification
Classification algorithms predict discrete categories or labels.

### Examples:
- Email spam detection (Spam or Not Spam).
- Medical diagnosis (Diseased or Healthy).
- Sentiment analysis (Positive, Negative, Neutral).

### Common Algorithms:
1. **Logistic Regression**
   - Used for binary classification.
   - Output is a probability between 0 and 1, mapped to classes.

2. **Decision Trees**
   - Splits data into subsets based on feature values.
   - Easy to interpret but prone to overfitting.

3. **Random Forest**
   - An ensemble method using multiple decision trees.
   - Reduces overfitting and improves accuracy.

4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
   - Finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes in feature space.
   - Works well for high-dimensional data.

5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - Classifies data points based on the majority class among the k-nearest neighbors.

### Evaluation Metrics:
- **Accuracy:** Overall correctness of predictions.
- **Precision & Recall:** Measures relevance and sensitivity.
- **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall for imbalanced datasets.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visualizes true vs. predicted labels.

## 2. Regression
Regression algorithms predict continuous numerical values.

### Examples:
- Predicting house prices based on features like size and location.
- Forecasting sales based on historical data.
- Estimating temperature changes over time.

### Common Algorithms:
1. **Linear Regression**
   - Models the relationship between features and target as a straight line.
   - Equation: \( y = mx + c \).

2. **Ridge and Lasso Regression**
   - Variants of linear regression with regularization to prevent overfitting.
   - Ridge adds L2 regularization; Lasso adds L1 regularization.

3. **Polynomial Regression**
   - Extends linear regression to capture non-linear relationships by adding polynomial terms.

4. **Decision Tree Regression**
   - Splits the dataset into segments and predicts values within those segments.

5. **Random Forest Regression**
   - An ensemble technique that averages predictions from multiple decision trees.

6. **Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)**
   - Builds models sequentially, where each model corrects the errors of the previous one.

### Evaluation Metrics:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures average squared errors.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Average absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
- **R-squared (\( R^2 \)):** Proportion of variance explained by the model.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Square root of MSE, in the same unit as the target variable.

## Workflow for Supervised Learning
1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - Collect labeled data.
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Normalize or standardize features if required.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Select the most relevant features.
   - Create new features based on domain knowledge.

3. **Model Selection:**
   - Choose the algorithm based on the problem type (classification or regression).

4. **Model Training:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train the model on the training data.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Use evaluation metrics to assess performance on the test set.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Optimize model parameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.

7. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the model into production for real-world usage.
