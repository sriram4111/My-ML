**Why we Use Polynomial Features?**

If your data has a non-linear relationship between features and the target variable, 
using polynomial features can help capture that complexity better than a simple linear model. By fitting regression_1 on these polynomial features,
the model can learn more complex patterns and potentially improve its predictive accuracy.
