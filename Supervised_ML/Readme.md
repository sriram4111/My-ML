**Why we Use Polynomial Features?**

If your data has a non-linear relationship between features and the target variable, 
using polynomial features can help capture that complexity better than a simple linear model. By fitting regression_1 on these polynomial features,
the model can learn more complex patterns and potentially improve its predictive accuracy.


**Pickling**

python pickle module is used for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. Any object in Python can be pickled so that it can be saved on disk. What Pickle does is it “serializes” the object first before writing it to a file. Pickling is a way to convert a Python object (list, dictionary, etc.) into a character stream. The idea is that this character stream contains all the information necessary to reconstruct the object in another Python script.
