# Unsupervised Machine Learning Projects

## Overview
This repository contains various educational projects on **Unsupervised Machine Learning**. 
The projects are designed to explore and implement clustering, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and other unsupervised learning techniques.

## Objectives
- Understand the principles and applications of Unsupervised Machine Learning.
- Implement different clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.
- Apply Dimensionality Reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE.
- Detect anomalies using Isolation Forest and Autoencoders.
- Use real-world datasets to analyze patterns and insights without labeled data.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow (for deep learning-based anomaly detection)
- **Visualization Tools:** Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Data Processing:** NLTK, Scipy, OpenCV (for image-based clustering)
