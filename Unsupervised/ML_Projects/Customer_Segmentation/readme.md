#  Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using **K-Means Clustering**.
Customer segmentation is essential for businesses to categorize their customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior and other characteristics. 
This helps in targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, and better customer relationship management.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Analyze customer data
- Apply K-Means clustering to segment customers
- Derive insights for business decision-making

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer-related attributes such as:
- **Customer ID**
- **Age**
- **Annual Income**
- **Spending Score**

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **NumPy** (for numerical computations)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning modeling)

##  Workflow:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Data cleaning and normalization
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

2. **Applying K-Means Clustering**
   - Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method
   - Implementing K-Means clustering
   - Visualizing customer segments

3. **Insights & Business Recommendations**
   - Interpretation of clusters
   - Business strategies based on segmentation
  


## Results
- The optimal number of clusters was determined using the **Elbow Method**.
- Customers were segmented into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior.
- Insights were derived to help businesses enhance customer engagement and sales strategies.

# Findings:
- In Mall they were **Low Annual** income customers spending also **less**.
- They were **Low Annual** income customers spending also **High** in mall.
- They were **Mid-Level** Annual income customers spending **MidRange** in mall.
- They were **High** Annual income customers spending also **less**.
- They were **High** Annual income customers spending also **less**.
- So, They were possibilites whose having low Annual income and High Annual Income whose spending less,Bussiness can give the **Discounts** and **Memberships 
  cards**
  

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing **hierarchical clustering** for better segmentation.
- Applying **deep learning techniques** for advanced customer profiling.
- Integrating **real-time data processing** for dynamic segmentation.
