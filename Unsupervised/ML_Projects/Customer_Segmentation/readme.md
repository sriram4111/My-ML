#  Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using **K-Means Clustering**.
Customer segmentation is essential for businesses to categorize their customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior and other characteristics. 
This helps in targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, and better customer relationship management.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Analyze customer data
- Apply K-Means clustering to segment customers
- Derive insights for business decision-making

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer-related attributes such as:
- **Customer ID**
- **Age**
- **Annual Income**
- **Spending Score**

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **NumPy** (for numerical computations)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning modeling)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Data cleaning and normalization
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

2. **Applying K-Means Clustering**
   - Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method
   - Implementing K-Means clustering
   - Visualizing customer segments

3. **Insights & Business Recommendations**
   - Interpretation of clusters
   - Business strategies based on segmentation
  
# WorkFlow :


## Results
